     * BlockStreamProducerConcurrent ensures that all the methods called on the producer are executed sequentially in
     * the order in which they are called by the handle thread. This is done by chaining the lastFutureRef to the next
     * write method.
     *
     * <p>By default, the BlockStreamWriterFactory will produce the concurrent block stream writer, so writes will not
     *    block the future chain for this producer. If we need to propagate the status of anything up, we should pass a
     *    CompletableFuture down to be completed, for example, if we need to ensure that a BlockStateProof is produced
     *    and the entire block has been flushed and persisted to disk.
     *
     * <p>This implementation of BlockStreamProducerConcurrent, the doAsync method chains asynchronous tasks in such a
     *    way that they are executed sequentially by updating lastFutureRef with the new task that should run after the
     *    previous one completes. This chaining uses thenCompose, which creates a new stage that, when this stage
     *    completes normally, is executed with this stage's result as the argument to the supplied function.
     *
     * <p>If any task in the chain completes exceptionally (for example, due to an exception thrown during its
     *    execution), the resulting CompletableFuture from thenCompose will also complete exceptionally with a
     *    CompletionException. This exception wraps the original exception that caused the task to fail. An
     *    exceptionally completed future will not execute subsequent completion stages that depend on the future's
     *    normal completion. If one of the futures in the lastFutureRef chain completes exceptionally, it effectively
     *    halts the execution of subsequent tasks that are dependent on normal completion. This could lead to a scenario
     *    where the chain of operations is stopped prematurely, and tasks that are supposed to execute next are skipped.
     *    This may not be an issue, because if one of these tasks fails, this node is unable to produce the block stream
     *    which is the entire purpose of its existence. If the block stream is not produced, the node is in a bad state
     *    and will likely need to restart.
     *
     * @param executor the executor service to use for writes
     * @param producer the producer to wrap
