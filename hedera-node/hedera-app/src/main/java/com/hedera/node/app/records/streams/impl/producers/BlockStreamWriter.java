/**
 *  Writes a block stream to a destination, such as a socket or in memory buffer.

 *  <p>A consensus node takes as input transactions from users, and produces a series of blocks. If the node
 *  fails to produce a block, then the node has effectively failed in its duty to produce a valid blockchain,
 *  and it must halt processing and reconnect. If enough nodes fail to produce a block, then the network will
 *  halt processing transactions. In this way, we can ensure that the network is always making progress without losing
 *  any data in the block stream.
